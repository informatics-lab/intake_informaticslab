# Intake Informatics Lab

Intake catalogues and associated drivers which provide access to hundreds of terabytes of Met Office data.

## Licence

Please note that individual datasets have different licenses and not all are fully open, e.g. some prohibit non-commercial use.

*Please ensure that you fully understand the license terms of the dataset before using the data.*

If using the catalogues made available in this package, the licenses are described [in the 'Datasets' section below](#datasets).
If accessing the data directly, or creating your own catalogue (and/or instance of the driver), the license is found in `LICENCE.txt` or `LICENCE.md` at the data root.

The code in this repository is made available under the MIT Licence.

## Datasets

### air_quality

Gridded dataset of air quality approximations for the UK for 01/01/20 to present. Created from multiple forecasts stitched in to a continuous time-series. For more information see [air quality technical details](https://metdatasa.blob.core.windows.net/covid19-response/README_data_air_quality.html).

#### License
Users are required to acknowledge the Met Office as the source of these data by including the following attribution statement in any resulting products, publications or applications:
"Contains Met Office data licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0"

This data is made available under [Open Government License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

### weather_continuous_timeseries

UK numerical weather model output from the UK Met Office. Data is from the very early time steps of the model following data assimilation, stitched into a continuous time series from many model runs. This data approximates an observation dataset. UK only from 01/01/20-present.

See the data [README](https://metdatasa.blob.core.windows.net/covid19-response/README_data.html) and the [technical docs](https://metdatasa.blob.core.windows.net/covid19-response/README_data_processing.pdf).

*Note:* The dataset contains global as well as UK data but the catalogue in this package currently only offers the UK.

### weather_forecasts

Weather forecast model output form the [Met Offices MOGREP UK and MOGREPS G models](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/ensemble-forecasting/mogreps), delayed by 24 hours. These models run as lagged ensemble but for simplicity in this catalogue it's being treated as more runs of less members in an un-lagged fashion.
